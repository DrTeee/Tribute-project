            <p id="tribute-info">Dr. Charles Robert Darwin FRS FRGS FLS FZS was an English naturalist, geologist and biologist, best known for his contributions to evolutionary biology. His proposition that all species of life have descended from common ancestors is now widely accepted and considered a fundamental concept in science. In a joint publication with Alfred Russel Wallace, he introduced his scientific theory that this branching pattern of evolution resulted from a process that he called natural selection, in which the struggle for existence has a similar effect to the artificial selection involved in selective breeding. Darwin has been described as one of the most influential figures in human history, and he was honoured by burial in Westminster Abbey.</p>

          <h3>Dr. Charles Robert Darwin Biography:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>1809: Born in  Shrewsbury, Shropshire, at his family home.</li>
            <li>1825: Darwin spent the summer as an apprentice doctor, helping his father treat the poor of Shropshire, before going to the University of Edinburgh Medical School (at the time the best medical school in the UK) with his brother Erasmus in October 1825. Darwin found lectures dull and surgery distressing, so he neglected his studies. He learned taxidermy in around 40 daily hour-long sessions from John Edmonstone, a freed black slave who had accompanied Charles Waterton in the South American rainforest.</li>
            <li>1831: Sailed the world on a 5-year voyage aboard the HMS Beagle.</li>
            <li>1836 - 1842: Evolution by natural selection: the London years.</li>
            <li> 1839: Darwin married Emma Wedgwood, his cousin, and they moved in to a house in London where Darwin could focus on his work. Unfortunately, his health started to fail mysteriously, so they moved to the country. They lived in a small village where Darwin could find peace and quiet.</li>
            <li>1871: The book on humanity and sexual selection, The Descent of Man, was published</li>
            <li>1872: The Expression of Emotions in Animals and Man was published.</li>
            <li>1877: The University of Cambridge gave him an honorary doctorate.</li>
            <li>1882: Darwin died on April 19, 1882, at the Down House. He was buried in Westminster Abbey.</li>
